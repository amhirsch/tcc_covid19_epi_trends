    <h2>Comparing the Summer Surge to the Fall Surge</h2>
    <p>
        We recall the summer surge of COVID-19 cases in Los Angeles County prevented the colleges from reopening in the fall.
        The question now is how is the current, fall surge of COVID-19 cases is impacting our ability to reopen for the spring semester.
    </p>
    <p>
        One may think "Los Angeles County has been reporting 1,500 cases a day during the middle of October,
        which is a better trend than the summer surge which saw over 3,000 cases a day."
        However, this comparison does not take into account that the summer surge peaked roughly 30 days before the fall semester began.
        The middle of October is roughly 100 days before the spring semester will begin.
    </p>
    <p>
        That being said, we have to compare the daily new cases set in the middle of October to the daily new cases set in the middle of May.
        These calendar dates are both 100 days out from the spring 2021 and fall 2020 semester respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
        The graphs below set out to compare the summer surge derailing reopening plans for the fall 2020 semester against our current fall surge, possibly affecting reopening plans for the spring 2021 semester.
        The horizontal, dashed lines show the daily new case targets Los Angeles County must reach in order to lessen restrictions.
        These exact case rate targets may shift occasionally as the California Department of Public Health adjusts the target based on a county's testing capacity per capita against the state's median testing capacity.

    California no longer uses hospitalization data as part of reopening decisions, but the graph may be of interest.
